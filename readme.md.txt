# Nearest

Hockey is a popular sport in Canada and many other northern hemisphere countries. Its also very expensive. One of the big costs is ice time. You really need 20 players and 2 goalies to have a decent game; this isn't always the case. 

HockeyHero is an app that allows you to search for players, goalies and refs in your area. 

Nearest is a service that, once populated with data, given a geolocation, radius and possibly other search criteria, will return players in that area.

The first generation app will be Web based. Once stable I would like to go mobile.
