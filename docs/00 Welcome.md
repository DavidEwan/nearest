# Welcome! 

You're here because you want to contribute to an Open Source project. I'm grateful for your contribution!

I assume you've already read the: 

- Contributing Guide
- Code of Conduct
- readme

I heard someone say the best way to manage an open source project is to "*...follow the principle of least astonishment and established convention*" which makes me chuckle. I will try to get it right but I will at some point undoubtedly get it wrong, but we live and learn. 

In these documents (/docs folder) I introduce you to the project and layout the workflow to help you get started fast. Ultimately I want the experience to be fun and encouraging for you. If this information doesn't help you get going please let me know. 



## What is Hockey Hero? 

This is the motivation paragraph. 

In Canada, and probably other northern hemisphere countries, hockey is a hugely popular recreational sport. Its also hugely expensive - especially ice time.  Ideally you need 20 players, 2 goalies and a referee for a game; that doesn't always happen. This is the problem I want Hockey Hero to address. It is (or will be) a website (and later hopefully mobile app) that allows you to search for and quickly contact players in your areas. This is what we are building. 

## What is Nearest? 

Nearest is the search engine of Hockey Hero. It is my implementation of a web service that, once populated, will answer questions like: 

- who are the players over the age of 35 within 5 miles of me? 
- who are the goalies between the age of 18 and 34 within 2 miles of me? 
- who are the referees within 3 miles of me? 

Nearest needs to be fast and accurate. Nearest is what we are building here.
